As soon as you entered your email address on the login form the magic begins.
With the entered email address a password is generated by prepend a 1 to the email address (example: email: test@post.ch, password will be test@post.ch1), this password will be filled in the password field and the form is submitted.

If the requested application also requires two step authentification, the displayed sms code is automatically filled in the textbox and this form is submitted as well.
